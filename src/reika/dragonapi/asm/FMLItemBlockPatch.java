 * <h3>Potentially Upset Readers</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a patch for FML so that it no longer tries to remove the vanilla blocks if the ItemBlocks mapped to them are removed.
 * Removing (and failing, as FML does) the blocks in this manner causes Forge to regenerate the id registry for modded blocks, scrambling them
 * in-world and completely destroying the save.
 * 
 * This is a temporary piece of code; I have since fixed the issue from happening in the future by adding an _technical to the registry names of the
 * ItemBlocks, but doing so would normally trigger the missing mapping this ASM is designed to fix. When I update to 1.8 - where it is a safe
 * assumption that no worlds will survive anyways - I can safely remove it in the knowledge that everyone is already under the new mappings.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Responses to Possible Criticisms</h3>
 *
 * <b>Why not just stop creating the ItemBlocks for technical blocks?</b>
 * <blockquote><p>
 * The ItemBlocks are required for rendering the blocks (all of which are unobtainable technical blocks like pumpkin stems, unlit redstone torches,
 * and portal blocks) as items in the inventory. Otherwise, the ItemStack created will have a null item and will immediately crash. Special-casing
 * 40 different renderers - all of which would have to be hand-written for these blocks - is an extremely onerous task.
 * </p><p>
 * Additionally, removing them does not remove the need for this ASM code until it is guaranteed that <i>everyone</i> has loaded the world without
 * the itemblocks and with this code present, as only then is the world safe to load without this code or the itemblocks. Given the difficulty in
 * getting many players to update at all, let alone use specific versions in sequence, such an approach is completely nonviable.
 * <b>Destroying existing worlds is absolutely unacceptable.
 * </b></p></blockquote><br />
 *
 *
 * <b>OMG WHY ARE YOU ASM-ING INTO FML ARE YOU INSANE!?!?!11!?</b>
 * <blockquote><p>
 * While this approach certainly <i>looks</i> insane, its only effect is to compensate for an unexpected edge case and oversight in FML.
 * It has no other effect on the code, and barring JVM errors, cannot cause any other issues.
 * </p></blockquote><br />
 *
 *
 * <b>Why not just make this a Pull Request into Forge?</b>
 * <blockquote><p>Because this code is to fix a rare edge-case, and said edge-case is one that design purists feel should <b>never</b> have
 * happened to begin with (and possibly in part due to the fact it was me who suggested it), all mentions of putting this natively into Forge/FML
 * were met with derision and hostility. While I never actually made a PR, when I mentioned my initial intentions to others, I was either laughed
 * at or flippantly told "maybe you shouldn't be rendering these blocks".
 * </p><p>
 * Additionally, at the time this code was written, all development on Forge/FML for MC 1.7 had been frozen. As such, even if the fix <i>had</i>
 * been included, it would have only made it into 1.8, making it far too late to be of any use.
 * </p></blockquote>
 * 
 *
 * <b>Why not use FML's MissingMappingEvent and ignore the missing mappings?</b>
 * <blockquote><p>I tried this. This does not fix the issue, because the call to GameData.block() is what actually breaks the data file, and
 * that is called regardless of the action type of the missing mapping.
 * </p></blockquote>
